The content of this repository is a set of scripts (currently being refined for publishing, not yet uploaded), usefull for structural analysis of buildings or associated benchmarks in Abaqus CAE software. 
Roughly, the scripts allow automation, and extract forces and displacements from numerical models.
Main usecases are seismic (or other) analysis of complete buildings (modelled by volumetric or shell elements), or running parametric analysis on benchmarks, IE larger number of analyses on a smaller model like a shear wall etc...

Here, along with the scripts, videos are provided explaining different levels of scripts. Showing how they can be used with almost no coding knowledge and, very basic coding knowledge, and with additional coding ho they can be specialised for different tasks. If you create a notable addaptation of the script, i would love to see it, publishing as a branch of this repository is an option.

These scripts are to be published in a article, which will be linked here. If you use them in research, please reference the provided article. (Link will be here as soon as it is published)
 - article link is to be provided by 2025
